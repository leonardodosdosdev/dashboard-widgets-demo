## Components

The DataWidget is the main widget for this project. To use it, add:

```
<DataWidget colConfig={<colConfig>} data={<data>} />
```

to a parent container, where 'colConfig' and 'data' are returned from the backend API.

## Configuration

The .env file contains the backend server URI value which serves the data for the widget.
